# Metaplex Candy Machine Core (a.k.a. Candy Machine V3)

> ðŸ›‘ **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**: This repository contain a proof-of-concept.

## Overview

The Metaplex Protocol's `Candy Machine` is the leading minting and distribution program for fair NFT collection launches on Solana. It allows creators to bring their asset metadata on-chain and provides a mechanism to create (mint) NFTs from the on-chain configuration &mdash; in both deterministic and non-deterministic (random) way, like a traditional candy machine.

The latest iteration of the `Candy Machine` program retains the core functionality of minting an NFT only, while any access control configuration is now done by the new [`Candy Guard`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/candy-guard) program.

The `Candy Machine` program is responsible for:
- config line (asset) management: configuration of how many assets are available and their metadata information;
- index generation and selection;
- NFT minting (token creation).

### Why separating mint logic and access control?

Previous versions of the `Candy Machine` included access controls to limit who can mint, when minting is allowed and other settings related to the mint (e.g., price) as part of its minting procedure. While the combination of the *mint logic* with *access controls* works, this design makes it complex to add more features or to remove undesired ones.

Creating a clear separation provides a modular and flexible architechture to add and remove access control settings, whithout the risks and complexities of breaking the minting logic. Each access control logic can be implemented in isolation and users can choose to enable/disable individual ones.

### Who can mint from a Candy Machine?

Each `Candy Machine` account has two authorities associated: an `authority` and `mint_authority`. The `authority` has permission to manage the configuration of the candy machine. This include adding config lines (assets), updating its settings, changing authority/mint authorities and closing/withdrawing the account.

The `mint_authority` is the only address that is able to mint from a candy machine &mdash; the only requirement being that there are NFTs to be minted from it. The `authority` of the candy machine can delegate the `mint_authority` to another address, either a wallet or PDA. This separation allows maximum flexibility and enables composability, since other programs can be set as `mint_authority` and provide additional features on top of the candy machine. An example of this is the [`Candy Guard`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/candy-guard) program, which provides access control guards for the candy machine.

## Account

The `Candy Machine` configuration is stored in a single account, which includes settings that control the behaviour of the candy machine and metadata information for the NFTs minted through it. The account data is represented by the [`CandyMachine`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/febo/candy-machine-core/candy-machine-core/program/src/state/candy_machine.rs) struct, which include references to auxiliary structs [`Creator`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/febo/candy-machine-core/candy-machine-core/program/src/state/candy_machine_data.rs), [`ConfigLineSettings`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/febo/candy-machine-core/candy-machine-core/program/src/state/candy_machine_data.rs) and [`HiddenSettings`](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/blob/febo/candy-machine-core/candy-machine-core/program/src/state/candy_machine_data.rs).

| *hidden section*            | 850    | ~    | (optional) Hidden data section to avoid unnecessary deserialisation. This section of the account is not represented by structs and data is store/retrieved using byte offsets. The hidden data section is not present when `hiddenSettings` are used, since there is no need to store config line settings. |
| - *items*</div>             | 850    | 4    | Number of NFTs (items) added to the candy machine; eventually this will be the same as `items_available`. |
| - *config lines*</div>      | 854    | ~    | A sequence of name and uri pairs representing each NFT; the length of these are determined by `name_length + uri_length`; there will `items_available * (name + uri)` pairs in total. |
